# Internet Forum

## User Stories:
1. User should be able to discuss things by topic/category.
2. A post should belong to its relevant category.
3. User should be able to create posts *(which will belong to them)* and categories *(which will be for everyone, maybe ask them to put in necessary information to keep all categories similar)*.
4. User should be able to comment on existing posts.
*sub-comments are __unnecessary__*
5. User should be able to see which posts have the most comments.
6. User should be able to vote on posts.
7. User should see posts based on popularity.


## ERD
![ERD sketch](/FullSizeRender.jpg)
* Nevermind the user_id in topic/category. A category shouldn't be assigned to one user. Categories belong to all users.
